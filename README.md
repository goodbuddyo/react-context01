# react-context01
This is an exercise in understanding React component design and working with React Context.
It is based on the Pluralsight course "Working with Components in React 18"t 
Author: Peter Kellner

After coding along with this course, the goal will be to use what is learned in the course for other applications.

To run, open a terminal and run 
`npm install`

Then, to run the app

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
